 The Taste of Melon
Borden Deal

When I think of the summer I was 16 a lot of things come crowding in to be thought about We had moved just the year before and 16 is 
still young enough that the bunch makes a difference I had a bunch all right but they weren't sure of me yet I didn't know why Maybe 
because I'd live in town and my father still worked there instead of farming like the other fathers did The boys I knew even Freddy 
Gray and JD still kept a small distance between us @


When I think of the summer I was 16 a lot of things#X come crowding in to be thought about We had moved just the year before and 16 is 
still young enough that the bunch makes a difference I had a bunch all right but they weren't sure of me yet I didn't know why Maybe 
because I'd live in town and my father still worked there instead of farming like the other fathers did The boys I knew even Freddy 
Gray and JD still kept a small distance between us

Then there was Willadean Wills I hadn't been much interested in girls before But I had to admit to myself that I was interested in 
Willadean She was my age nearly as tall as I and up till the year before Freddy Gray told me she had been good at playing Gully Keeper and 
Ante-Over But she didn't play such games this year She was tall and slender and Freddy Gray and JD and I had several discussions about 
the way she walked I maintained she was putting it on but JD claimed she couldn't help it Freddy Gray remarked that she hadn't 
walked that way last year He said she'd walked like any other human being So then I said put on or not I liked the way she walked 
and then there was a large silence 

It wasn't a comfortable silence because of Mr Wills Willadean's father We were all afraid of Mr Wills 

Mr wills was a big man He had bright fierce eyes under heavy brows and when he looked down at you you just withered The idea of having him directly and 
immediately angry at one of us was enough to shrivel the soul All that summer Willadean walked up and down the high road or sat 
on their front porch in a rocking chair her dress flared out around her and not one of us dared do more than say good morning to her 

Mr Wills was the best farmer in the community My father said he could drive a stick into the ground and grow a tree out of it 
But it wasn't an easy thing with him Mr Wills fought the earth when he worked it When the plowed his fields you could hear him 
yelling for a mile It was as though he dared the earth not to yield him its sustenance 

Above all Mr Wills could raise watermelons Now watermelons are curious things Some men can send off for 
the best watermelon seed they can plant it in the best ground they own they can hoe it and tend it with 
the greatest of care and they can't raise a melon bigger than your two fists Other men like Mr Wills 
can throw seed on the ground scuff dirt over it walk off and leave it and have a crop of the prettiest 
biggest melons you ever saw 

Mr Wills always planted the little field directly behind his barn to watermelons It ran from the barn 
to the creek a good piece of land with just the right sandy soil for melon raising And it seemed as 
though the melons just bulged up out of the ground for him
